                It is the first modern twin cylinder motorcycle developed by the company.
                 <br>
                In 2017 it was revealed, inspired by the 1960s Interceptor which had a 750cc engine. 
                The Interceptor 650 was unveiled alongside the Continental GT 650, which shares the same engine. 
                The Interceptor is a retro-cruiser with relaxed ergonomics, while the Continental GT is a café-racer with minor changes for performance.
