                    <br>

                    The Front-end consists of HTML and CSS codes also the use of EJS and Bootstrap Templates, the
                    contents such as pictures and descriptions
                    can all be found on opensource materials in the internet.
                    <br>
                    The Back-end consists of Javascript, NodeJS and the use of NPM node packages such as Express. This
                    is the server
                    side that handles the websites behavior, navigation and authentication.
