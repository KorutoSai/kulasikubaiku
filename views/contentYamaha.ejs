                    <p class="lead">Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. is a Japanese
                        mobility manufacturer that produces motorcycles, motorboats, outboard motors, and other
                        motorized products.
                        The motorcycle division of Yamaha was spun off in 1955, being incorporated on 1 July 1955 in
                        Japan, and was headed by Genichi Kawakami. Yamaha's initial product was a 125 cc (7.6 cu in)
                        two-cycle, single cylinder motorcycle, the YA-1, which was a copy of the German DKW RT 125. The
                        YA-1 was a competitive success at racing from the beginning, winning not only the 125cc class in
                        the Mt. Fuji Ascent, but also sweeping the podium with first, second and third place in the All
                        Japan Autobike Endurance Road Race that same year.

                        that approach this authentic machine. Discover their unique designs.

                        Yamaha has marketed the SR400 in the JDM since model year 1978, with a production
                        hiatus for model years 2008â€“2009.
                        The SR400 has an air-cooled 4-stroke single cylinder SOHC 2-valve engine with a dry-sump, with
                        the downtubes of the motorcycle's frame serving as the engine's oil reservoir and cooling
                        system, thereby eliminating the need for an external oil cooler, reducing engine pumping
                        losses, and allowing increased ground clearance as well as reduced overall width. The bike's
                        semi-double cradle frame uses high-strength steel.
