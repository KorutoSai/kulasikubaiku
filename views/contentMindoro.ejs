                    <p class="lead">
                        Mention Mindoro and most people immediately think of Puerto Galera.
                        This party beach that’s easily accessible by sea travel from Batangas Port is one of the most
                        popular weekend destinations for those based in the metro. But that’s literally just the tip of
                        the island. The rest of Mindoro has much more to offer. Mindoro is actually the seventh largest
                        island in the Philippines and is composed of two provinces: Oriental Mindoro and Occidental
                        Mindoro.

                    <h3> Why Mindoro?</h3>
                    <br>
                    Mindoro is one of the largest islands of the Philippines with over 480+ km (almost complete)
                    circumferential road. For riders based in Manila who want to bring their own motorcycles, it’s a
                    matter of boarding a ferry from Batangas Port (roughly 2-5 hours from Manila depending on the
                    traffic) to cross to the island. The ferry ride itself lasts 1 – 3 hours.
                    <br>
                    Mindoro is divided in the middle by beautiful mountain ranges, giving riders both coastal and
                    mountain views. You can choose to start and end the loop in different provinces as your entry or
                    exit points.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    NOTE: As of May 2019, a 4-km stretch of road connecting Puerto Galera to Abra de
                    Ilog in the northern part of Mindoro is still under construction. According to locals, some
                    motorcycles have been able to cross this, but it still involves rough roads and river crossings.
                    <br>
                    There’s also a new 50-km cross-country road being built that zigzags through the mountains
                    connecting Sablayan in Occidental Mindoro to the town of Victoria in Oriental Mindoro. This road
                    is not yet marked on Google maps.

                        Baco is the former capital of Oriental Mindoro.
                        In a story told by anthropologist and missionary, Rev. Antoon Postma, the first parochial church
                        in Oriental Mindoro was established in Baco in the year 1567.
                        Due to this, it was declared the first official capital of Oriental Mindoro in 1575. Baco was
                        considered the cabecera town.
                        However, when Corregidor Joseph de Chavez became Governor of Oriental Mindoro in the year 1678,
                        Calapan was declared the new capital of the province.

                    <p class="lead">

                        Our Mindoro Loop trip took 5 days including 1 day to get there and back and 1 overnight
                        island-hopping trip.
                        Based on my odometer reading and Google Map estimates, we traveled almost 1,000 kms. But more
                        than the distance,
                        this trip meant a lot more to me.
                        <br>
                        I’ve said it before, but there’s really something immensely satisfying about looping an island.
                        Well, not completely.
                        As of this writing, there’s still that 4-km stretch of the road connecting Puerto Galera to Abra
                        de Ilog that under construction and is not yet passable.
                        I guess it’s only a matter of time before more tourists discover the beauty of the Occidental
                        side.
                        But for me, the charm lies in how raw and rugged the place is. I hope it stays that way.
